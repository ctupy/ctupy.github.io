        <h1>Christine's Intresting Topic</h1>
        <p>Since Halloween is coming up, I have decided to talk about the <strong>Winchester Mystery House</strong>.
            After her husband died, Sarah Winchester was told by a medium that she is <strong>cursed</strong> and <strong>haunted</strong>
            by those killed by the Winchester rifles. She was told that in order to evade the angry spirits, she would 
            have to <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/winchester-mystery-house">"move out west, buy a home, and build nonstop."</a>

            Another legend states that if she would stop building, she would <strong>die</strong>. 
            
            Due to the mansion being built to house countless spirits, it is considered <strong>one of the most haunted houses in the world</strong>.
